We used the challenger dataset.

Open up Parallel.html in Chrome.

The Scatter Plot Matrix represents combinations of each of the challenger variables. Hovering over a point will change its color in each graph. Hovering for a little longer will display a tooltip with coordinate values. Clicking on a point will cause it to change color and stay changed until it is clicked again.

The Parallel Coordinate visualization represents the same data. Similarly, hovering will change the color of the line, which represents one test from the dataset. Hovering for longer will display each value from the test. Clicking will change the color of the line until clicked again.

Both graphs maintain which circles have been hovered over and clicked on. This allows the user to keep track of data points they find interesting between both representations of the data. We wanted to have the lines activate when the circles were hovered over, but had issues selecting the lines in javascript.
